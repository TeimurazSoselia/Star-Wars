# Star-Wars

This is a simple web application that allows users to browse and search for Star Wars characters. 
The app fetches character data from the SWAPI (Star Wars API), providing detailed information about each character,
including attributes like height, mass, gender, and more.

How to Open the Project

Open the project in your code editor.
If you're using Live Server, right-click on the force-awakens.html file and select "Open with Live Server".
This will automatically open the app in your default web browser.
Alternatively, you can open the force-awakens.html file directly in any modern web browser.

Despite design is intuitve here is the guide for navigation:
Search: Users can search for characters by name.
Character Details: Clicking on a character reveals more information, such as height, mass, gender, etc.
Show More/Show Less: Allows users to toggle between basic and detailed character information.
Pagination: Navigate through the character list if there are multiple pages of results using "previous" and "next" buttons.
